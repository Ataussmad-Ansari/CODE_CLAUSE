        <p><b>#</b><br>In C, the "#" symbol is primarily used for preprocessor directives. Preprocessor directives are instructions to the C preprocessor, which is a tool that processes your code before it's compiled by the C compiler.</p>
    <p><b>include</b><br>You can use #include to include header files in your C program. This allows you to access functions and declarations from those header files in your code. A C header file is a text file that contains pieces of code written in the C programming language. The name of a header file, by convention, ends with the '.h' extension.</p>
    <p><b>stdio.h</b><br>In C programming, stdio.h is a header file that stands for "standard input-output header." It is an essential header file that provides functions and macros for performing input and output operations in C programs.</p>
    <p><b>return ytpe (int)</b><br>This is the return type of the main function. It indicates that the function will return an integer value when it completes. By convention, a return value of 0 is used to indicate successful program execution, while a non-zero value is often used to indicate an error or abnormal termination.</p>
    <p><b>main()</b><br>The main function is the entry point of a C program. Every C program must have a main function, and the program execution starts from this function. Inside the main function, you write the actual code for your program. This code can include declarations of variables, function calls, control structures (e.g., if, for, while), and any other C language constructs.</p>
    <p><b>{}</b><br>These curly braces define a block of code. All the code that belongs to the main function is placed within these curly braces.</p>
    <p><b>printf()</b><br>The printf() function is used for output (displaying text) in the C programming language. It allows you to format and print text to the standard output (usually the console).</p>
