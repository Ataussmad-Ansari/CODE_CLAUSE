        <h1>History of C Language</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that was created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It evolved from an earlier language called B and was developed to write the Unix operating system. C quickly gained popularity for its simplicity, efficiency, and portability. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published "The C Programming Language," also known as K&R C, which became the definitive reference for the language.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, C became widely adopted for system programming, and its popularity continued to grow. In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to standardize the C language, resulting in the ANSI C standard, published in 1989. This standard was later adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO C.</p>
        <p>C's influence extended beyond operating systems and system programming. It served as the foundation for the development of C++ and Objective-C, two prominent programming languages. C also played a significant role in the early days of software development for embedded systems, and it remains relevant in that domain.</p>
        <p>Some of the popular programming languages before C language are given in the table below:</p>
